Assignment Activity and Guidance
Task 1: Handling Orders

1.1 Class Diagram Design:

    Draw a class diagram including Order, Item, Queue, DLLOrder, and DLLItems, illustrating their relationships, information hiding, and Abstract Data Type (ADT) specifications.

1.2 Implementation:

    Implement the solution based on the specified classes and prevent handling orders when the queue is empty or creating an invoice for an empty list of items.

1.3 Testing:

    Test the implementation using a Demo class, demonstrating how the specified ADT solves the problem. Present sample testing results.

1.4 Queue Illustration:

    Draw an illustration showcasing how the queue handles orders in a First-Come-First-Serve (FIFO) manner, providing examples.

1.5 Queue Implementation Comparison:

    Consider implementing the Queue class over an array and a Singly Linked List (SLL). Discuss implementation details, space and time complexities, and potential trade-offs.

1.6 Stack Specification:

    Define a stack specification to assist in Mac's plate stacking scenario, demonstrating how a stack can handle the solution.

Task 2: ADT and OOP

2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:

    Discuss and justify whether ADTs are the basis of Object-Oriented Programming.

2.2 Encapsulation and Information Hiding:

    Discuss the performance of sorting algorithms concerning implementation, complexity, array sizes, and different shapes, evaluating outcomes against intentions.

Task 4: Adding a Delivery Feature

4.1 Shortest Path Algorithms:

    Define the closest MacDonald's branch for each client using Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's algorithms, illustrating the tracing process.

4.2 Algorithm Complexity Analysis:

    Critically analyze the complexity of both algorithms in reference to their data structure implementations.

Feedback and Recognition

The feedback from the Doctor of Data Structures and Algorithms acknowledges the student's achievement in examining ADT, implementing sorting algorithms, and analyzing the operation of shortest path algorithms.
